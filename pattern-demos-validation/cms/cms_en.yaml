                For an example of dual-field validation using two datepickers, the system will first perform client-side validation to check if both the 'From' and 'To' dates are selected (empty validation), then perform server-side validation to ensure the 'From' date is before the 'To' date (date order validation). Please select a 'From' date and a 'To' date for the event. If you don’t fill both fields, validation will be triggered as soon as you click the 'Validate' button.

              startDate: Start date
              startDateDescription: For an example of single-field validation, the system will first perform client-side validation to check if any value is selected (empty validation), then perform server-side validation to check if the start date for the event is in the future (future date validation).
                Please select a future start date for the event. If you don’t, validation will be triggered as soon as you click the 'Validate' button.

              validationDisabled: Validation disabled
Validation:
  dateNotInFuture: '{0}: Please select a future date.'
  fromAfterToDate: From date ({0}) is after To date ({1}).
  isRequired: '{0}: Value is required'
